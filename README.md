Designer course format for Moodle
========================
The Designer course format is a course builder â€” teachers can choose different layouts for each section in order to display activities and resources in a more meaningful and beautiful way. Moodle provides robust activities for effective learning and teaching, but the course home page often lacks visual appeal and teachers are overwhelmed to create a beautiful course with core tools.

Moodle release support
----------------------
This plugin is maintained for the two most recent major releases of Moodle as well as the most recent LTS release of Moodle. 
If you are running a legacy version of Moodle, but want or need to run the latest version of this plugin, you can get the latest version of the plugin, remove the line starting with $plugin->requires from version.php and use this latest plugin version then on your legacy Moodle. However, please note that you will run this setup completely at your own risk. We can't support this approach in any way and there is an undeniable risk for erratic behavior.

Translating this plugin
-----------------------
This Moodle plugin is shipped with an english language pack only. All translations into other languages must be managed through AMOS (https://lang.moodle.org) by what they will become part of Moodle's official language pack.
